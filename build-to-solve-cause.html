<p>2019-04-29</p>
<p>Lately I have been wrestling with the thought that we as a whole are moving towards a reactive future. We build things, those things create problems, we build more things to solve those problems, they then create more problems. Essentially we are building to solve the things we mess up.</p>
<p>Building reactively does not have any major detrimental effects, aside from the lack of innovation on selecting the problem part. Selecting the right problem to work on is half the job done, and building reactively causes us to focus on the symptoms and not the causes.</p>
<p>Take the case of Global Warming for example. From the point we build the world&rsquo;s first Steam Engine to 2019 we have messed up the atmosphere pretty bad. Temparatures are on the rise, polar ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising and we&rsquo;re in pretty hot deep mess. But we&rsquo;re also building solutions to counteract these changes. Making artificial rain, emission control policies all are helping except they all have one problem in common, they are treating the symptoms. Rather than building to solve the problems we should attack the root cause, the buildup of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere. That is the only viable path forward.</p>
<p>Consider you have an account with a payment gateay and they blocked it out of no reason and are not listening to your pleas to reopon the account. Building reactively would mean creating a new account with the same or another payment gateway and waiting for the issue to repeat. Bulding to solve the cause would mean building your own payment solution with a payment provider such as Stripe</p>
<p>Also building reactively seriously curbes innovation as the problem space would be really narrow, and the solution space will be constrained by the root cause.</p>
<p>We should always strive to build solutions to solve the root cause of a problem. Building to solve the symptoms are only temporary and would always require operation because the underlying cause is always strong. Solve the cause and the symptoms will take care of themselves.</p>
